To test this file, download the RAW code from GitHub onto your computer
You can use curl, wget, etc.

Open mongosh and use the load('Mongo_Hotel.js'); command to load the script
If all is good, you should see "true"

To test the validator, play around with inserting incorrect/correct documents.
use db.collection.insert({}) command!

Enjoy,
